BAM - Bugzilla automated monitor
=============================

BAM is a tool to create daily statistics of bugs from Bugzilla.
Tool fetches the snapshot of current statuses of selected bugs according to rules defined in the configuration and:
- generate the information about number of unconfirmed / open / resoved / unreleased / unverified / active bugs.
- compare the snapshot with the previous one and generate the information about changes in bug statuses
  (how many bugs have been reported / resolved / released / verified).

The idea is that statistics are generated every day morning and presents:
- the status in the time when they have been generated.
- changes in bugs' statuses in previous day.
So e.g.:
- the statistics generated in Tuesday morning, week 7 are visible on the web page as statistics from Monday, week 7.
- the statistics generated in Monday morning, week 8 are visible on the web page as statistics from Sunday, week 7
  (or e.g. Fri-Sun, week 7, when statistics are taken in working days only).



CONFIGURATION:
=============================

1/ Create the user for fetching data from Bugzilla, e.g. bugstats

2/ Copy the content of the 'src' to corect folders

3/ Configure Apache

4/ Create configuration files for statistics you want to fetch.


------------------
Apache:

1/ PHP module must be installed for apache

2/ GD extension must be enabled in php

3/ Fonts (to generate graphs): packages: ttf-dejavu, ttf-dejavu-core
   You can change font used on graphs in lib/static_variables.php

4/ parameters file: lib/static_variables.php
   You must update variables of default strings visible on page.
   If you don't do that then each configurable string will be preceded with "!!" characters.



------------------
perl script:

1/ Prepare configuration files (see example files).
   You can generate the products list file by executing 'check_product_list_of_classification.pl' script with additional parameters.

2/ Add proper line to the /usr/local/bin/fetch_statistics.sh file.

3/ Set credentials to access the Bugzilla in .netrc file of the home directory of the user running perls script.
   Format: machine projects.maemo.org login xxxxx password xxxxxx
   chmod 600 .netrc

4/ Create the 'data' folder for statistics (the one defined under STATISTICS_BASE_PATH variable) and ensure that user running perl scripts has access to write to this folder.

5/ Create the cron file (see example file); define EMAIL [, REPLYTO, proxy, if you need] in the cron file.
   In the example cron executes the /usr/local/bin/fetch_statistics.sh script, in which is defined what reall should be done.


------------------
To create new statistics:

1/ create new config file(s).

2/ add new line to the /usr/local/bin/fetch_statistics.sh file.
